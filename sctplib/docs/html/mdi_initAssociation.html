This is the second function needed to fully create and initialize an association (after
mdi_newAssociation()) THe association is created in two steps because data become available
at the a-side in two steps
<OL>
<LI> associate
<LI> init acknowledgement
</OL>
At the z-side, with the cookie message all data is available at once. So mdi_newAssociation
and mdi_initAssociation must be called when the initAck with valid Cookie is received.
