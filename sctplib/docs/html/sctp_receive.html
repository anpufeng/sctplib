sctp_receive is called in response to the dataArriveNotification to
get the received data.
The stream engine must copy the chunk data from a received  SCTP datagram to
a new byte string, because the SCTP datagram is overwritten when the next datagram
is received and the lifetime of a chunk in the streamengine might outlast the
the reception of several SCTP datagrams.
For this reasons and to avoid repeated copying of byte strings, a pointer to
the byte string of chunkdata allocated by the streamengine is returned.
According to the standard, the chunkdata should be copied to to a buffer provided
by the ULP.
